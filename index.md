I am a PhD candidate at the [Earth and Space Sciences Department](https://www.ess.washington.edu/), University of Washington. I study glaciology and use data from geophysical techniques and modeling to study changes in the near-surface and englacial processes of alpine glaciers and ice sheets. I also pursue cryospheric science communication and further DEI initiatives at the University of Washington.
